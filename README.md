Read data from Near Inidexer Public Database

This was an attempt to read transactions from the public database that is provided by [NEAR](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-indexer-for-explorer#shared-read-only-access-to-the-databases)

Works as quick hacky solution but not scalable as the receipts of a transaction are executed across different blocks and that could be a bottleneck to scale
